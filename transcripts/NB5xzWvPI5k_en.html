        <h2 class="frutiger">Meet Henri</h2>
        <p>I'd have to say the most satisfying thing about my job is definitely making a difference in people's lives.</p>
        <p>My names Henri. I'm in charge of around about 550 to 600 clients. I look after their needs and any of their requirements in terms of banking.</p>
        <p>These clients are considered the higher net-worth clients. I deal with all aspects of their life using the four cornerstones of Scotiabank. So I'm looking at their investments, I'm looking at their credit, their day-to-day banking, and their insurance needs. Making sure these are all met and looking for opportunities to essentially improve their life and make them financially better off.</p>
        <p>Typical day in my job is we come in at 8:30am and we usually will look through our agenda, see what happened yesterday, what weve got coming in for today.</p>
        <p>I would say probably 50% of my day is involved in face to face with the customer. The other 50% of the day is paperwork processing - because you know a mortgage file or something like a RSP investment portfolio takes a long time to put together. So you've got to spend the time to do the paperwork as well as the interaction.</p>
        <p>The day never really stops, there's always something to be doing.</p>
        <p>To be honest, if I had to choose one thing that I really, really, like about this job is - it has got to be the teamwork and the team dynamics within a Scotiabank branch.</p>
        <p>We all do rely on each other, we do all look out for each other, and often a scenario's going to happen in the branch where you're looking at high pressure, last minute scenario happening... everything needs to be done and you need support.</p>
        <p>You can't possibly do this problem or whatever, on your own. So the team is always there to help you out.</p>
        <p>We have a motto here at Scotia - One Team, One Goal. We're always looking to benefit the customer and make everybody as financially better off as possible and we're always trying to help them.</p>
        <p>If the people you work with really make you like coming to work, and really find it enjoyable place to work, then what else could you ask for in a job to be honest?</p>
